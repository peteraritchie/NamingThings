# Thoughts on the complexity of noun phrases

Uncle Bob: "classes should be nouns or noun phrases".

anon: Resource names should be nouns.

## noun phrases:

> the devil in disguise

A noun phrase in the form of a subject compliment.  The proble here, with class or resource names,
is that the phrase cannot be the subject because it compliments something else that is the subject.
In fact, the subject would be more likely to be the class or resource name.

> Singing in the bath

Although a noun phrase (_singing in the bath_, when used with as the subject of a verb), alone is a gerund phrase.
Gerunds can act like noun phrase (the object), particple phrase; and thus an adjective phrase.
As gerund phrases can be used as verbs, they should be avoided as the _noun phrase_
of a class or resource unless it's the only option.

Typically a class models behavior, or performs actions; i.e. a subject.  Resources (RESTful)
generally receive an action (PUT POST GET TRACE DELETE OPTIONS HEAD) and are objects (oddly enough).

Of course, a noun phrase can have a pronoun.  A noun phrase based on a pronoun is usually not suitable
for a class or resource name despite potentially.
